With the advancement of web technology and its growth, there is a huge volume of data present in the web for internet users and a lot of data is generated too. 
Nowadays, millions of people are using social network sites like Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, etc., to express their emotions, opinion and share views about their daily lives. 
I have used Sentiment analysis which can be defined as a process that automates mining of attitudes, opinions, views and emotions from text, speech, tweets and database sources through
Natural Language Processing (NLP). Sentiment analysis involves classifying opinions in text into categories like "positive" or "negative" or "neutral". 
It's also referred as subjectivity analysis, opinion mining, and appraisal extraction.

I used the sentiment140 dataset. It contains 1,600,000 tweets extracted using the twitter api . 
The tweets have been annotated (0 = negative, 4 = positive) and they can be used to detect sentiment .
